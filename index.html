    I been tryna recover
But this soul tie shit been driving me insane
I'm in the passenger's seat and the doors are locked
So I can't get out like I just got detained
I try breaking the glass but I didn't get far
Now I got a four-five up to my brain
She told me don't move I been lying to my fans
When I say that I'm okay 'cause
She comes and goes I get too close
My heart on froze I can't let her go
She comes and goes I get too close
She lets me go
Just one night and it turns to loads
I don't even know if I'll make it home
She comes and goes, she says let's go
My mind says yes but my heart says no
She came and she went, now I gotta recover
But I'm trapped in the same damn cycle
She like my rival, star crossed-lovers
I'm holding a knife but she holding a rifle
I know what she's on so I'm taking cover
I'm ready for war, but I gotta be mindful
Holding back, now she feeling entitled
Excuse my french, build a tower then I fall
Fuck, I think now that I'm healing
I gotta stiffen my lip and stand right up
It's fucked 'cause I really been slouching
Feeling sorry for myself like I'm worth nothing
Get the fuck up the world still counting
Cuh the world don't stop for any damn thing
So get up! You better start grinding
Just get the fuck up! And stop all this crying
Every day I been getting so close to my dream
They say I make hits when I pick up my pen
I think I found myself
It's going so well but how will it end?
I'm back on track again
So there's no way I can lack again
But what if I turn my back again
So I turned my back and she back again
FUCK!
She comes and goes I get too close
My heart on froze I can't let her go
She comes and goes I get too close
She lets me go
Just one night and it turns to loads
I don't even know if I'll make it home
She comes and goes, she says let's go
My mind says yes but my heart says no
Somehow she's back again
What the fuck do I do?
I don't know what to say
I'm fucked I know I shoulda blocked her account
I did, but she made another one same day
I hate it so much that my dm's are open
I can't close them 'cause I love my fans
I try ignore it but she knows where I am
And I can't get away so I let her land
The same damn girl that was fucking me up
Way more than once, am I fucking insane?
Justify what she did in the past
I'm thinking its calm, might give her a chance
And this is what love just does heart
Makes you a dartboard, vulnerable to your half
If they want a bullseye then they're gonna get it
They'll close one eye and aim straight for your heart
And that's why I'm so twisted
Now I'm back in this constant cycle
I couldn't give a fuck if my heart's so vital
I'd rip that out for the person I'd die for
I don't know if it's love
Or I just love hard or I guess I'm a psycho
Anyways if you feel like me
We'll get thru it soon and it's like
I been tryna recover
But this soul tie shit been driving me insane
I'm in the passenger's seat and the doors are locked
So I can't get out like I just got detained
I try breaking the glass but I didn't get far
Now I got a four-five up to my brain
She told me don't move I been lying to my fans
When I say that I'm okay 'cause
She comes and goes I get too close
My heart on froze I can't let her go
She comes and goes I get too close
She lets me go
Just one night and it turns to loads
I don't even know if I'll make it home
She comes and goes, she says let's go
My mind says yes but my heart says no
She comes and goes I get too close
My heart on froze I can't let her go
She comes and goes I get too close
She lets me go
Just one night and it turns to loads
I don't even know if I'll make it home
She comes and goes, she says let's go
My mind says yes but my heart says no
